Crystal Collector is an interactive web browser game that dynamically updates the HTML within the webpage using the jQuery library.

### How It Works
* There are four crystals that are displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. (The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal, and it will be up to the player to remember this value.)
* When the player clicks a crystal, the app updates the player's score counter.
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game, and the player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* To restart the game, the player must click "Play again" and the values of each crystal and the random number that must be reached will be changed.
